      "value": "<p>At 20th level a summoner and his eidolon share a true connection. As an action, the summoner can assume the shape of his eidolon, copying all of its evolutions, form, and abilities.</p><p>Your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores change to match the base scores of you eidolon. You can choose to have any gear you carry become absorbed by this new form, or dropped on the ground. Items with continuous effects continue to function while absorbed in this way.</p><p>The summoner loses his natural attacks and all racial traits (except feats, skills, and languages) in favor of the abilities granted by his eidolonâ€™s evolutions. The summoner retains all of his class features. The summoner can keep this form for a number of minutes per day equal to his summoner level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The summoner can end this effect as a free action.</p>",
